# Spam-Classifier-using-SVMs
Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy.
In this project, I used SVMs to build my own spam filter. I trained a classifier to classify whether a given email, x, is spam 
(y = 1) or non-spam (y = 0). In particular, I converted each email into a feature vector x 2 Rn.  The dataset included for this
project is based on a subset of the SpamAssassin Public Corpus.3 For the purpose of this project, I only used the body of the 
email (excluding the email headers).
